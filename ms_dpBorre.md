#### Study area descriptions/descriptor:
Sierra Nevada (Andalusia, SE Spain), is a mountainous region with an altitudinal range between 860 m and 3482 m a.s.l. covering more than 2000 km2 (Figure 1). The climate is Mediterranean, characterized by cold winters and hot summers, with pronounced summer drought (July-August). The annual average temperature decreases in altitude from 12-16ºC below 1500 m to 0ºC above 3000 m a.s.l., and the annual average precipitation is about 600 mm. Additionally, the complex orography of the mountains causes strong climatic contrasts between the sunny, dry south-facing slopes and the shaded, wetter north-facing slopes. Annual precipitation ranges from less than 250 mm in the lowest parts of the mountain range to more than 700 mm in the summit areas. Winter precipitation is mainly in the form of snow above 2000 m of altitude. The Sierra Nevada mountain range hosts a high number of endemic plant species (c. 80; Lorite et al. 2007) for a total of 2,100 species of vascular plants (25% and 20% of Spanish and European flora, respectively), being considered one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in the Mediterranean region (Blanca et al. 1998; Cañadas et al. 2014). 

This mountain range has several legal protections:  Biosphere Reserve MAB Committee UNESCO; Special Protection Area and Site of Community Importance (Natura 2000 network); and National Park. The area includes 61 municipalities with more than 90,000 inhabitants. The main economic activities are agriculture, tourism, cattle raising, beekeeping, mining, and skiing (Bonet el al. 2010).


#### Design description:

Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory (OBSNEV) (Bonet et al. 2011) is a long-term research project which is being undertaken at Sierra Nevada Biosphere Reserve (SE Spain). It is intended to compile the information necessary for identifying as early as possible the impacts of global change, in order to design management mechanisms to minimize these impacts and adapt the system to new scenarios (Aspizua et al. 2010, Bonet el al. 2010). The general objectives are to:  

* Evaluate the functioning of ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada Nature Reserve, their natural processes and dynamics over a medium-term timescale.* Identify population dynamics, phenological changes, and conservation issues regarding key species that could be considered indicators of ecological processes. * Identify the impact of global change on monitored species, ecosystems, and natural resources, providing an overview of trends of change that could help foster ecosystem resilience. * Design mechanisms to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of management activities performed in the Sierra Nevada in order to implement an adaptive management framework. * Help to disseminate information of general interest concerning the values and importance of Sierra Nevada.

The Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory has four cornerstones: 

1. A monitoring program with 40 methodologies that collect information on ecosystem functioning (Aspizua et al. 2012; 2014)
2. An information system to store and manage all the information gathered ([http://obsnev.es/linaria.html](http://obsnev.es/linaria.html) - Pérez-Pérez et al. 2012; Free access upon registration)
3. A plan to promote adaptive management of natural resources using the knowledge amassed through the monitoring programme
4. An outreach program to disseminate all the available information to potential users (see News Portal of the project at [http://obsnew.es](http://obsnev.es)  and the wiki of the project at [http://wiki.obsnev.es](http://wiki.obsnev.es), Pérez-Luque et al. 2012)

The Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory is linked to other national (Zamora and Bonet 2011) and international monitoring networks: GLOCHAMORE (Global Change in Mountain Regions) (Björnsen 2005), GLOCHAMOST (Global Change in Mountain Sites) (Schaaf 2009), LTER-Spain (Long-Term Ecological Research). 

*Una frase similar a esta:
Sierra Nevada Global Change Observatory is collecting socio-ecological information on the major ecosystem types found in Sierra Nevada. This information is being integrated in an Information System (http://obsnev.es/linaria.html - Pérez-Pérez et al. 2012. (Free access upon registration). The dataset described here is a good example of this idea. We have created a relational database to store the floristic inventories prepared in 2004–2005. Thanks to this work, all this valuable and unique information will be available to scientists and environmental managers worldwide.*

#### Methods

#####Study extent description: 
The Mediterranean high-mountain meadows (know locally as “*borreguiles*”) are ecosystems conditioned by the snow dynamics and potentially sensitive to changes in water availability and temperature (CITA). In Sierra Nevada mountain range this ecosystem occupy 1125 ha and its distribution is determined by accumulation of the meltwater (CITA). Aunque solo representa un XX % de toda la superficie de Sierra Nevada, this ecosystem has a high rate of plant endemicity (Table 1) (Bonet et al. 2010).

This ecosystem contains several plant communities arranged as parallel bands in relation to water courses (Lorite et al XXXX). The floristic composition of these communities depends on moisture content of the substrate. First, on some moist soil, as a transition from dry grasslands to borreguiles themselves, there is a medium coverage grassland called ***dry borreguil***. It hosts species such as *Armeria splendens*, *Agrostis nevadensis*, *Potentilla nevadensis*, *Plantago nivalis*, *Arenaria tetraquetra* subsp. *amabilis* or *Euphrasia willkommii* (among others) (Lorite XXXX, Lorite in Blanca). (Figura 5). Then ***dense grassland*** appears, located in areas with constant moisture throughout the summer. As typical species of this community include *Nardus stricta*, *Pinguicula nevadensis*, *Leontodon microcephalus*, *Luzula hispanica*, *Ranunculus demissus* and *Campanula herminii*. Moreover, in the rocky promontories areas forming the borreguil are enriched with the presence of *Vaccinium uliginosum* subsp. *nanum* and *Ranunculus acetosellifolius*. In places where there is constant flooding and still waters until fall, the optimum conditions of oxygen deprivation exist for ***incipient peat formations*** are installed. These communities are characterized by the presence of species such as *Carex intricata* jonquils , *C. echinata*, *Eleocharis quinqueflora*, *C. lepidocarpa* subsp. *nevadensis*, *Juncus articulatus*, *Ranunculus angustifolius* or *Festuca frigida*.

We selected one of the most representative borreguiles of Sierra Nevada, located at San Juan Basin river (Guejar-Sierra; Granada, Spain) (Figure 4). This meadow occupies an area of XX ha, and the catchment area is about XX ha. This basin formed by glacial erosion of the bedrock (mica schists) and presents a valley with U-shape (Martín Martín et al. 2010). 


##### Sampling description: 
We sampled at three localities along an altitudinal gradient (figura): one at Prado de la Mojonera (Low Altitude; around 2200 m a.s.l.) and two at Hoya del Moro (Middle and High altitude; 2430-2550 m a.s.l. and around 2775 m a.s.l respectively). 

For each locality, the sampling was performed every 15 days during the free-snow period once a year from 1988-1990 and from 2009 to 2012. For the middle altitude locality we have data from two periods: 1988-1990 and 2009-2013. For low and high altitude locations we have data from 2009-2013 period.  

In each locality permanent plots of 1 x 1 m were randomly distributed. In each plot a floristic inventory was carried out. The presence/absence and an estimation of abundance-coverage using the Braun-Blaquet cover-abundance scale (Braun-Blanquet 1964) were recorded for each taxa. We also counted the number of individuals belong to three main phenological phase (phenophase) established: vegetative phenophase, reproductive phenophase (flowering) and seed phenophase. Plots were divided into quadrats of 25 x 25 cm to facilitate counting (Figure 6).
